# `JustStreamIt` Front-End Project

## Preamble
This script was designed for a school project with specific requirements and fixed constraints.
It was developed in a limited period of time and in this context this project is not intended
to evolve that much once "finished". This project is not open to contribution.
The following need is fictive.

## About The Project

### Project context
I offer my help to a film-loving association to create their website. They already have an API with which I can retrieve movies data. The idea is to display the movies by IMDB rating and by categories, with a Netflix slideshow style.

### About the website visible architecture and functionalities
The main page displays :
- 4 sections with a slideshow : 1 section for the best overvall movies, 3 sections for specific genres (crime, history and sport).
- An insert to highlight the best film.
- A modal with the movie details when a cover is clicked.

### About the application design and compliance
The application : 
- is using Vanilla JavaScrip (no framework) to retreive data from the API and to display dynamic content,
- is valid W3C HTML and W3C CSS,
- is comptatible with small screens.
